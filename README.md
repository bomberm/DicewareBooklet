# DicewareBooklet
LaTex Files and directions for creating both long and short form diceware booklets

* All booklets are in the form <BookletType>.tex, which can be edited by most basic text editors (notepad, notepad++, vi/vim) or any tex editor such as TexStudio or kile
* The booklets have been compiled successfully using both TexStudio and kile, as well as ShareLatex (for testing purposes). While there are some compile warnings
	(such as hbox or h float specifiers) they will not prevent the document from compiling or create display errors. 
* Booklets should be compiled into a PDF type for best success with the next steps.
* Currently the best method for converting from single sheet to a book-type document is using the 'booklet' options in Adobe Acrobat Reader, which allows for a 'booklet'
	print option. This option correctly flips and spaces pages so that when printed, the pages can be folded in half and appear in the correct sequence with center stapes. (See LongList and Long ListRough Draft pdfs for examples of pre-booklet conversion and post-booklet conversion)
